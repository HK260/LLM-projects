# ðŸ’° SmartPricer: LLM-Powered Price Estimator

SmartPricer is a hybrid machine learning and language model pipeline designed to estimate the price of home appliances using structured metadata and unstructured product descriptions. This project compares a traditional linear regression baseline with a fine-tuned **LLaMA 3.1 8B** model using **QLoRA** for regression from natural language.

## ðŸ§  Project Goals

- Predict product prices based on metadata and description text
- Benchmark traditional ML against LLM-based regression
- Showcase the impact of instruction-tuned LLaMA models on numerical prediction tasks

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

```python
error = abs(guess - truth)
log_error = log(truth + 1) - log(guess + 1)
sle = log_error ** 2
average_error = sum(errors) / N
rmsle = sqrt(sum(sles) / N)

```
